The tuna supply chain faces critical challenges regarding traceability, transparency and sustainability due to certain issues such as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Within the tuna supply chain, traceability can play a critical role in enhancing consumer transparency and ensuring adherence to environmental and legal standards. By leveraging blockchain technology, this research combines qualitative insights of supply chain stakeholders and uses the information to evaluate the potential of blockchain in improving product traceability and accountability within the supply chain.
