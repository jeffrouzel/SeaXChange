\chapter{Preliminary Results/System Prototype}
\section{Overview}
This chapter  presents the preliminary results or the system prototype.  Included in this chapter are screenhots and the discussion of results. The tuna supply chain management smart contract on Hyperledger Fabric has been initiated and tested within a controlled blockchain environment. Results indicated that the system was functionally robust and reliable, having managed assets, transaction integrity, and the ability to query and update the ledger in the blockchain. This chapter presents the details of the major steps executed during the process, results for those steps, and the current status of the prototype's operations.The tuna supply chain management smart contract on Hyperledger Fabric has been initiated and tested within a controlled blockchain environment.
